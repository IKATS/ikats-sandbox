## What is IKATS?

IKATS (*I*nnovative tool*K*it for the *A*nalysis of *T*ime *S*eries) is the result of a R&D Data Science Project and is carried out by [CS Syst√®mes d'Information](http://www.c-s.fr) in collaboration with the [AMA LIG team](http://ama.liglab.fr/).

IKATS provides a ready to use toolkit for the handling, exploratory analysis and visualization of large volumes of industrial Time Series (TS) data within a single big data framework.

The project website is hosted at : [https://ikats.org](https://ikats.org)

There is also a [community and a commercial support](https://ikats.org/support.html).

## What is the _IKATS Sandbox_ (and what it's not)

- IKATS was primarily designed to work on cluster of machines and not a single desktop.
- Our IKATS Sandbox repository allow you to use it nevertheless, but user must be aware that its performance is not representative of the tool.
- Especially, some algorithms which use [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) could monopolize all desktop resources and make irreversibly freeze it, depending on the amount of data processed at a time.
- Data persistence: all data imported and generated in ikats are persisted as long as `/var/lib/ikats/docker_bindings` directory is not manually deleted or altered.

## Installation on Linux

### Prerequistes

The _IKATS Sandbox_ is known to work on that system :

- Linux version: Ubuntu 16.04
- 8 Go of RAM
- Dual core CPU @ 2.40GHz
- Docker CE 17.12.1-ce
- docker-compose 1.19.0

### Install steps for Ubuntu

#### Tooling

First, you have to get and setup the necessary tooling. If you have already installed on your system Docker, docker-compose and Git tools, you can jump to [Get the Sandbox](#get-the-ikats-sandbox) :

- Follow the [Get Docker CE for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) documentation
  - Do not forget the [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
  - If you are behind a corporate proxy, follow Docker's instructions on how to [configure your Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy])
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Install GIT, follow the [Git Book instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) or if you are on a debian system, simply enter the command line : `sudo apt-get install git`

#### Get the IKATS Sandbox

1. Clone the `ikats-sandbox` GitHub repository

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/SCM
    cd ~/SCM
    git clone https://github.com/IKATS/ikats-sandbox.git
    ```

2. Create the necessary directories for persistent data (our `docker_bindings`)

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/ikats/IKATSDATA
    sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} /var/lib/ikats/
    ```

3. Get and extract the [`latest`](https://github.com/IKATS/ikats-sandbox/releases/latest) release of the file `sandbox_docker_bindings.tar.gz` ([list of releases](https://github.com/IKATS/ikats-sandbox/releases)).  
    Example, for release `x.y.z`:

    ```bash
    IKATS_RELEASE=x.y.z
    wget -P /tmp/ "https://github.com/IKATS/ikats-sandbox/releases/download/${IKATS_RELEASE}/sandbox_docker_bindings.tar.gz"
    tar xzf /tmp/sandbox_docker_bindings.tar.gz -C /var/lib/ikats
    rm /tmp/sandbox_docker_bindings.tar.gz
    ```

4. (optional) Get and extract data needed for [IKATS tutorials](https://ikats.org/tutorials.html)

    ```bash
    IKATS_RELEASE=x.y.z
    wget -P /tmp/ "https://github.com/IKATS/ikats-sandbox/releases/download/${IKATS_RELEASE}/sandbox_hourly_weather_import_data.zip"
    mkdir /var/lib/ikats/IKATSDATA
    unzip /tmp/sandbox_hourly_weather_import_data.zip -d /var/lib/ikats/IKATSDATA
    rm /tmp/sandbox_hourly_weather_import_data.zip
    ```

### Test your IKATS Sandbox

1. Launch the IKATS containers with Docker Compose

    ```bash
    cd ~/SCM/ikats-sandbox
    ./start_IKATS.sh
    ```

2. Depending on the `.env` file configuration, open to the IKATS Workbench in your browser `http://${GUI_IP}:${GUI_PORT}`

## Next steps

- Read the [Getting started tutorial](https://ikats.org/doc/tutorials/tuto_workflow.html)
- You could [import your "small" data](https://ikats.org/doc/tutorials/tuto_imports.html). Remind that you are on a limited system.
- Other tutorials are available on the IKATS website starting from the [How to... section](https://ikats.org/howto.html)
- Troubleshooting:
